This is a challenge project which I completed to test my skills in Linear and Multiple Regression .

Goal of the Project:

Explore different parameters and build a perfect formula which to calculate the winnings

Overview of my approach

Started with a couple of linear regressions so find the best single parameter to predict the data
Next, Tried and tested a few multiple linear regressions with 2 parameters
And Finally came up with a model with 3 parameters to predict the data

I also concluded by comparing the efficiency of my model with the best suited parameters given my CodeCademy 

Challenges faced:

I read the including parameter which is strongly correlated to some other existing parameter in your model would decrease the overall score because of redundency,So picking a pair of parameters which were strongly correlated to my outcome and not correlated within themselves was quite a challenge since a lot these were correlated with themselves.

Feeback and suggestions are appreciated.
